Assign Credential
=================
Since Blureprints are exported as clear text, they do not retain credential information that could potentially be used maliciously.  You'll be required to set the **Credentials**.  set the creddentials as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  Credential Name : WINDOWS
  Username        : ntnxlab.local\administrator
  Secrete         : password
  Password        : nutanix/4u
  
Once complete, click the **Back** buttoin located in the upper right, and then click **Save** along the top menu bar.


Configure Blueprint Variables
=============================
The **windowsMSSQL2014** blueprint uses service variables to configure pre and post runtime behavior.  The blueprint configuration variables can be accessed by clicking on the **Service** tab of blueprint located to the right of blueprint workspace.

Enable CredSSP
==============
To Enable CredSSP on the Karan host, please follow steps below:

1. On the Karan Host run the following command to enable CredSSP as a client role and allow Karan host to Delegate credentials to all computers ( Wild card mask "*")
 Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client -DelegateComputer *
2. From command prompt window run “gpedit.msc”
3. In the group policy editor window Goto Computer-configuration -> administrative templates -> system ->credential delegation
4. Double click on “Allow Delgating Fresh Credentials with NTLM-only server authentication”
5. Select Enable radio button
6. Click on the show button
7. In the value field add  “WSMAN/*”. This allows delegate fresh credentials to WSMAN running in any remote computer

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab3/image6.png

.. note:: Please note that an XML script to auto join the MSSQL VM to the domain is included in this lab. This would usually be an additional step for deployment.


Click **Create** to launch the application.

Once the application has been launched, the Application Management Dialog will appear showing the state of the Application.  Click the *Audit* button in the tool-bar located along the top of the Application Management Dialog to monitor or audit the provisioning progress of the application.
