Comtrade HYCU
-----------------------

Overview
++++++++

.. note::

  Estimated time to complete: **1 HOUR**

  **Due to limited resources, this lab should be completed as a group.**

Comtrade HYCU is the only solution built from the ground up to deliver a full suite of backup capabilities for Nutanix AHV, eliminating a key barrier to entry for AHV prospects. Additionally, as pure software, HYCU can help grow Nutanix deals as additional nodes are positioned to act as a backup target for workloads.

In this exercise you will configure a HYCU appliance, configure the connection to your Nutanix cluster, configure a Nutanix Volume Group to act as a backup target, and execute backup and restore operations at the VM, file, and application level.

Adding A Backup Target
++++++++++++++++++++++

The target is used for storing backups coordinated by HYCU. HYCU supports S3, Azure, NFS, SMB, and iSCSI storage targets. The recommended target configuration for Nutanix is an iSCSI connection to a Nutanix Volume Group.

From **Prism > Storage > Table > Storage Container**, select **+ Storage Container**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/9.png

Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

  - **Name** - Backup
  - Select **Advanced Settings**
  - Select **Compression**
  - **Delay (In Minutes)** - 0
  - Select **Erasure Coding**

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/10.png

.. note:: Erasure Coding is well suited to backup target use cases as retained snapshots will become write cold and not frequently overwritten.

From **Prism > Storage > Table > Volume Groups**, select **+ Volume Group**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/11.png

Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

  - **Name** - HYCU-Target
  - **iSCSI Target Name Prefix** - HYCU-Target
  - **Description** - HYCU Target VG
  - Select **+ Add New Disk**
    - **Storage Container** - Backup
    - **Size (GiB)** - 1000
  - Select **Enable external client access**
  - Select **CHAP Authentication**
  - **Target Password** - nutanixnutanix
  - Select **+ Add New Client**
    - **Client IQN** - *<HYCU iSCSI Initiator IQN>*

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/12.png

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/13.png

.. note::

  By default, Comtrade's recommendation is 1 disk per Volume Group. Customers can utilize > 1 disk per Volume Group today to increase throughput to support a greater number of concurrent backups. Currently, Comtrade Support should be engaged to configure > 1 disk per Volume Group.

  CHAP passwords must be between 12 and 16 characters long.

Select **HYCU-Target** and note the **Target IQN Prefix** in the **Volume Group Details** table. Triple-click this value to fully select it. Copy the value to your clipboard.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/14.png

From **Prism >** :fa:`cog` **> Cluster Details**, note the **iSCSI Data Services IP**. Click **Cancel**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/15.png

From the **HYCU Web Interface**, select **Targets** from the sidebar.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/16.png

Click **+ New**, fill out the following fields, and click **Save**:

  - **Name** - NutanixVG
  - **Description** - *<Nutanix Cluster Name>* HYCU-Target VG
  - **Type** - iSCSI
  - **Target Portal** - *<Nutanix iSCSI Data Services IP>*
  - **Target Name** -
  - Select **CHAP**
  - **Target Secret** - nutanixnutanix

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/17.png

.. note:: Maximum concurrent backups is a factor of how much disk throughput the backup target is capable of providing. Comtrade is currently developing guidance for concurrent backups based on Nutanix hardware configuration.

Configuring Backup Policies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From the **HYCU Web Interface**, select **Policies** from the sidebar.

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/18.png

By default HYCU is configured with 4 different Policies:

  - **Gold** - 4 Hour RPO, 4 Hour RTO
  - **Silver** - 12 Hour RPO, 12 Hour RTO
  - **Bronze** - 24 Hour RPO, 24 Hour RTO
  - Exclude - Backup not required

To create a custom policy, click **+ New**.

Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

  - **Name** - Fast
  - **Description** - 1 Hour RPO/RTO, Fast Restore Enabled (1 Day)
  - **Enabled Options** - Fast Restore
  - **Backup Every** - 1 Hours
  - **Recover Within** - 1 Hours
  - **Retention** - 4 Weeks
  - **Targets** - NutanixVG
  - **Fast Restore Retention** - 1 Day

  .. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/ts18/hycu/19.png

.. note::

  HYCU supports multiple advanced configurations for backup policies, including:

  - **Backup Windows** - Allows an administrator to define granular time of day and day of week schedules to enforce backup policy.
  - **Copy** - Asyncronously copies data from the primary backup target to a configurable secondary backup target during periods of non-peak utilization.
  - **Archiving** - Allows an administrator to target slower, cold storage for long term retention.
  - **Fast Restore** - Retains local snapshots on the Nutanix cluster for rapid restores.
  - **Backup from Replica** - For VMs that use native Nutanix replication from a primary cluster to a secondary cluster, this feature will backup VMs from the replicated snapshots on the secondary cluster. This functionality can significantly reduce data movement for scenarios such as Remote Office Branch Office.

  HYCU is also unique in its ability for administrators to define desired RTO. By specifying a desired **Recover Within** period and selecting **Automatic** target selection, HYCU will compute the right target to send the VM. The performance of the target is constantly monitored to ensure it can recover the data within the configured window.

Select the **Exclude** policy and click **Set Default > Yes**.

.. note:: This will set the default policy for VMs to not be backed up by HYCU. In a production environment you could choose the appropriate policy to minimally backup all VMs by default.
